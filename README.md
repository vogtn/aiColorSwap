# aiColorSwap - simple, easy, no code themes.
desc: Chorme Extension that uses ai color api (colormind) to generate a palette

Ref: http://colormind.io/

Theming is an important part of any design system, beyond light and dark modes. As more companies begin to embrace comprehensive design systems (Microsoft Fluent, Google Material UI), differentiation through theming becomes an easy utility to create a unique, robust, application. Manually updating the components if not hooked up right can be tedius, and users might be unsure of proper color matching theories.

The intention of this app is to make an easy way for the user to generate a color palette, and apply them to the page or components in real time.
